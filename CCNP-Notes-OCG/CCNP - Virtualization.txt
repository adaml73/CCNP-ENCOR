CCNP - Virtualization
	server virtualization:
		Hypervisors
			vmware vsphere, hyper-v, xenserver, red hat KVM
		type 1: bare metal
		type 2: run on a host os (typically used by clients, like vmware fusion/virtualbox)

	Container:
		share underlying resoures of host os, lightweight application instances
		dependencies are packages in the container image

		most popular container engines
		* rkt (rocket)
		* open container initiative
		* LXD ("lexdi", from canonical)
		* linux-vserver
		* Windows containers
		
	Virtual switching
		vswitch - software based L2 switch

		docker - creates a default vbridge called Docker0
			default subnet block 172.17.0.1/16
			
	Network Functions Virtualization
		architectural framework created by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ESI)
		defines standards to decouple network functions from proprietary hardware-based appliances, and instead run on x86 based servers
		
		network function (NF) = function performed by a physical appliance, (i.e. router, switch, firewall)
		
		NFV Infrastructure - hardware and software components that comprise the platform where virtual network functions are deployed

		Virtual Network Functions
			- Software or virtual version of an NF. Typically run on a hypervisor as a VM
				commonly used for layer 4 - 7 functions
				(like loadbalancers or application delivery controllers, firewalls, intrustion detection systems, and wan optimization appliances)

			common examples:
				* cisco CSR1000v
				* Cisco CSP2100
				* Cisco ISRv
				* cisco NGFWv
				* Cisco ASAv

		Virtual infrastucture manager
			responsible for managing and controlling the NFVI hardware resources (compute,storage, network) and lifecycle management

			service chaining - chaining VNFs together to provide an NFV service or solution
			
			element managers (EMs) - aka Element Management Systems - responsible for the functional management of VNFS
				EX: fault, config, accounting, performance, and security fuctions for vnfs (an EM can also be an VNF)

		Management and Orchestration
			NFV Orchestrator - responsible for creating, maintaining and tearing down VNF network services
				NFV orchestrator and VNF manager are together known as NFV management and orchestration (MANO)

		Operations support system/Business support system
			OSS - typically provided by service providers, can assist with inventory, configuration, resolving network issues
			BSS - Product management, customer management, and revenue management (billing)
			
	VNF Performance 
		north-south - into hosting server through a physical nic, sent to a VNF, then sent from the VNF back out to the physical wire
		east-west - into hosting server through a pnic and sent to a vnf, then could be sent to another VNF, and possibly service chained to more VNFs then sent out the physical 			wire

		I/O technologies developed to prevent CPU interrupts from packet processing - (physical NIC must support these technologies in order to implement them)
			* OVS DataPlane development kit (OVS-DPDK)
			* PCI Passthrough
			* Single-root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)

			OVS-DPDK
				
			PCI Passthrough
				allows VNFs to have direct access to physical PCI devices, downside is you can only assign one PCI device to a single VNF
				
			SR-IOV
				enhancement to PCI passthrough
				allow multiple VNFs to share the same pNIC
				
				Virtual Ethernet Bridge (VEB) - traffic between VNFs attach to the same pNIC os hardware switched directly to the pNIC

				Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) - traffic between VNFs attached to the same pNIC is switched by an external switch

			Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization (ENFV)
				multiple network devices on one x86 platform

				management centralized via DNA center

				supports cisco SD-WAN cEdge and vEdge virtual router onboarding
				
				Supports Third Party VNFs
	
			ENFV solution architecture:
				MANO
				VNFs
				NFVIS - network functions virtualization infrastructure software (NFVIS) - operating system, provides virtualization capabilities and faciliatates the 						deploment and operation of VNFs/hardware components
				
				hardware resources - x86 based compute resource 
			
				Cisco support VNFs
					* Cisco ISRv for routing
					* Cisco ASAv - firewall
					* cisco NGFWv - firewall and intrusion detection/prevention
					* Viptela vEdge
					* cEdge
					* Cisco vWAAs - wan optimization
					* Cisco vWLC - wireless lan controllers

				Third Party VNFs
					* thousandeyes
					* fortinent
					* paloalto
					* infovista
					* CTERA
					* Windows Server
					* Linux Server

				x86 hosting platforms
					* Cisco enterprise network computing system (ENCS)
					* Cisco cloud services platform
					* cisco 4000 series ISR w/ cisco UCS e-series blade
					* UCS c-series
