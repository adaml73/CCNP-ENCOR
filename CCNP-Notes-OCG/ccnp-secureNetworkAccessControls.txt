EAP
inner auth methods are tunneled within PEAP, EAP-FAST, and EAP-TTLS
aka outer or tunneled TLS authentication methods

EAP-MD5
uses MD5 to hide credentials in a hash
hash is sent ot auth server
does not have a method for mutual authenticaiton

EAP-TLS
uses TLS PKI
provides mutual authentication of supplicant to auth server and auth server ot supplicant
both supplicant and auth server must be assigned a digital certificate signed by a CA
this is the most secure auth method, but also the most difficult to deploy as a result of the admin burden 

PEAP
only auth server requires a certificate
PEAP forms a tunnel between supplicant and auth server, then uses one of the following methods to auth the supplicant through the outer PEAP
TLS tunnel

EAP-MSCHAPv2 (PEAPv0) - clients credentials are sent to server. most common method, sent to radius server
EAP-GTC(PEAPv1) - created by cisco as an alternative to MSCHAPv2 to allow generic auth to vertually any identity store
EAP-TLS - most secure EAP auth method, essentially a tls tunnel in a tls tunnel, rarely used due to admin burden
EAP-FAST - mush like PEAP, developed by cisco as an alternative to PEAP to allow for faster re-auths and support for roaming
		uses PACS to reauth faster, (protected authentication credentials) 

EAP-TTLS - much like peap, but not as common. EAP-TTLS can support additional inner methods such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, unlike PEAP


EAP chaining
included with EAP-FAST
supports machine and user auth inside a single outer TLS tunnel


MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB)
port based access control - using mac address of an endpoint, typically a fallback from 802.1x

authenticator (switch) waits three unanswered EAPoL identity request, determines the endpoint does not have a supplicant, drops back to MAB
opens port to learn mac address of device, with that the switch crafts a radius access-request message, and sends it off


Web Authentication (WebAuth)
like MAB, but only for users, not devices
two types
	* Local Web Authentication
	* Centralized Web Authentication with Cisco ISE

Local Web Authentication
	First form created
	redirects https to portal
	portal is not customizable, does not support AUP (acceptable use policy), password 	changing, device registration, and self-registration
	also does not support vlan assignment, only supports ACL assignment. 
	
Central Web Auth with Cisco ISE
	supports dACLs, VLAN auth, advanced services, etc

Enhanced Flexible authentication (FlexAuth)
	AKA Access session manager
	allows multiple authentication methods concurrently 
	allows endpoints to be brought online faster instead of waiting in succession for 	each method to fail
	Key component of IBNS 2.0 Integrated solution

Cisco Identity-based networking services (IBNS 2.0)
	Integrated solution offering Authentication, Access control, and user policy 	enforcement
	combo of the following
	* Enhanced FlexAuth
	* Cisco common classificaiton language (C3PL)
	* Cisco ISE
	
Cisco TrustSec
	uses Security Group Tags
	performs ingress tagging and egress filtering to enforce access control policy
	(refered to as Scalable Group Tags in SD-Access)

	configuraiton happens in three stages
		* ingress classification
		* propagation 
		* Egress enforcement
	Ingress classification
		assigning tags to users, endpoints, ect
		can be done in two ways
		* dynamic assignment - downloaded as an auth option from ISE

		* Static - (could be used in datacenters)
			* IP to SGT tag
			* Subnet to SGT tag
			* VLAN to SGT tag
			* L2 interface to SGT tag
			* L3 interface to SGT tag
			* port to SGT tag
			* port profile to SGT tag
	Propagation
		process of communicating mappings to the trustsec network devices that will 
		enfoce policy
		Two methods
		* Inline tagging (native) - switch inserts SGT tag inside a frame to allow upstream devices to read and apply policy
			only supported by cisco hardware with ASIC support for trustsec, frame will be dropped by anything else
		* SXP propagation - TCP based peer to peer protocol, used for devices that do not support SGT inline tagging in hardware (speaker/listener pairs)
			- also available via pxgrid
	Egress enforcement
		enfocement of policies
		two major ways of doing so
		* Security Group ACL (SGACL) - enforcement on routers and switches, access lists filter based on source and destination SGT tags
		* Security Group Firewall (SGFW) - enforcement on firewalls, needs tag-based rules to be defined locally on the firewall

	
	MACsec
	IEEE 802.1AE - L2 hop-by-hop encryption method
		only encrypted between swithces/devices, unencrypted to swithc can review
		Based on ethernet frame format
		Adds an additional
			16-byte MACsec security tag field (802.1AE Header)
			16-byte Integrity Check Value (ICV)
		authentication via Galois Method Authentication Code (GMAC) or authenticated encryption using Galois/Counter Mode Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-GCM)

		Ethertype, first two octets - 0x88e5
		
		Two MACsec keying mechanisms are available
			* Security Association Protocol (SAP) - cisco proprietary, used between cisco switches
			* MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) protocol - provides required session keys and manages encrypiton keys

		Downlink MACsec - encrypted link between an endpoint and a switch
				uses MKA keying protocol

		Uplink MACsec - encrypting link between switches with 802.1ae, use SAP by default- AES-GCM-128 encryption, can be done manually or dynamically
				dynamic requires 802.1x auth between switches
