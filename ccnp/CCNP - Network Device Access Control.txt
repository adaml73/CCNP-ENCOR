CCNP - Network Device Access Control and Infrastructure Security

Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	Permit or deny packet classification, based on ACE match statements
	Order of operations, top (lowest sequenct) to bottom (highest sequence) until match is found
	
	Numbered standard ACL - based on source network, use numbered entries 1-99 and 1300 and 1999
		Example: 
		access-list 1 deny 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
		access-list 2 permit any 
		interface GigabitEthernet0/1
		 ip access-group 1 in
	
	Numbered extended ACLs - based on source, destination, protocol, port, or combo, use numbered entries 100-199, and 2000-1699
		Example: 
		access-list 100 deny tcp any any eq 23
		 access-list 100 deny icmp any any
		 access-list 100 deny ip host 192.168.100.1 host 10.1.2.1
		 access-list 100 permit any any
		interface GigabitEthernet0/1
		 ip access-group 100 in
	
	Named ACLs - standard and extended ACLs that can be given names
		Example:
		*Named Standard
		ip access-list standard STANDARD_EXAMPLE_ACL
		 deny 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
		 deny host 192.168.100.1
		 permit any
		 exit
		interface GigabitEthernet0/1
		 ip access-group STANDARD_EXAMPLE_ACL in
		
		*Named Extended
		ip access-list EXTENDED_EXAMPLE_ACL
		 deny tcp any any eq 23
		 deny icmp any any
		 deny ip host 192.168.100.1 host 10.1.2.1
		 permit ip any any
		 exit
	
	Port ACLs (PACLS) - extended MAC ACLS to filter traffic on L2 switchports	
		restrictions
		 only support filtering incoming traffic on an interface
		 cannot filter L2 control packets (CDP, VTP, DTP, UDLD, STP, ECT)
		 supported only in hardware
		 do not support acls to filter IPv6,ARP, MPLS
		
		Examples: 
		ip access-list extended PACL
		 deny tcp any any eq 23
		 deny icmp any any
		 deny ip host 10.1.2.2 host 10.2.1.2
		 permit ip any any
		 exit
		interface GigabitEthernet0/1
		 switchport
	 	 ip access-group PACL in 
		
	
	VLAN ACLS (VACLs) - extended MAC ACLs to filter traffic on VLANs, filter traffic bridged within a VLAN, or routed into/out of a VLAN
		Example: 
		*Drop Telnet traffic 
		ip access-list extended TELNET
		 permit tcp any any eq 23
		 exit
		ip access-list extended OTHER
		 permit ip any any
		 exit
		vlan access-map VACL_20 10
 		 match ip address TELNET
		 action drop log
		 exit 
		vlan access-map VACL_20 20
		 match ip address OTHER
   		 action forward
		*apply the vlan filter with the command below
		vlan filter VACL_20 vlan-list 20
	
	
	*all use wildcard masks
	
	interations/order of operations	
		*if assigned on a port by ISE, dACL assigned by ISE overwrites PACL
	

Terminal Lines and Password Protection
	Console (cty)
	 line con 0 (show line as cty)
	
	auxiliary port (aux) - line aux 0 (mainly used for access via modems)
	
	Virtual terminal (vty) - line vty 0 4 - 
		
	 
	Password Types
		type 0 - most insecure, not encrypted, (enable password)
		type 5 - Uses MD5, only cracked via brute force, recommended over type 0 and type 7 (enable secret, username secret)
		type 7 - cisco proprietary Vigenere encryption, easily cracked. (service password-encryption)
		type 8 - PBKDF2 sha-256. considered uncrackable
		type 9 - SCRYPT, considered uncrackable

	Password encryption
		service password-encryption 
			encrypts all type 0 password (ex: bgp password)
			any passwords configured before will remain unencrypted, and need to be reenetered. 
			encrypts with type 7, so easily crackable

	Username and Password authentication
		configuring a username
			username () password () - plaintext type 0 
			username () secret () - type 5
			username () algorithm-type [md5|sha256|scrypt] secrect () - type 5, type 8 or type 9, this is prefered

		configured line local password auth
			on the line:
			login con 0
			 password ()
			 login
		configure line local username and password
			on the line:
			*global config
			 username () secrect/password, ect
			login con 0
			 login local

privledge leves and role-based access control (RBAC)
	Priv level 0 - includes disable, enable, exit, help, and logout commands
	priv level 1 - (aka user EXEC) (r1>) - from here, not possible to make config changes
	priv level 15 - (aka Priv EXEC)(r1#) - all cli commands available

	different levels can be configured
		range 2 to 14
		privilege [mode] level [level] [command string]	
		ex:
			username cisco privilege 5 secret Cisco
			privilege configure level 5 interface

		when logging in, view priv level with 
			show privilege
			
Controlling access to vty lines w/ ACLs
	access-list 10 permit 10.12.0.0 0.0.0.255
	access-list 10 deny any
	line vty 0 4
	access-class 10 in
	
	transport input [all|none|telnet|ssh|telnet ssh]

	verify access
	show line 

Enabling SSH vty access	
	SSH version 1 (SSHv1) - should be avoided
	SSH version 2 (SSHv2) - certified under NIST, should be used

	How to configure
		1. configure hostname
			hostname [hostname]
		2. configure a domain name
			ip domian-name [domain-name]
		3. generate crypto keys
			crypto key generate rsa
			- you will be prompted to select modulus, needs to be atleast 768

		to force SSHv2, use 
			ip ssh version 2
	Auxiliary Port
		disable with 
			line aux 0
				no exec
	Exec timeout
		exec-timeout [minutes][seconds]
		default setting is ten minutes

		to disable exec timeout - both work
			exec-timeout 0 0
			no exec-timeout

	absolute timeout
		terminates an exec timeout after a specified timeout, even if connection is 		being used, recommended to give users a warning

		line vty 0 4
		 exec-timeout 2 0
		 absolute-timeout 10
		 logout-warning 20

Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)
	Authentication - allows users to be identified and verified before getting access to a device/service

	Authorization - defines access privileges and restrictions

	accounting - Basically keeps a log, gives the ability to track and log user access, including
			* User IDs
			* start and stop times
			* permitted CLI commands
	
	two most popular protocols 
		* Radius and TACACS+

	two most common use cases
		* access to network equipment - TACACS+ is the prefered protocol
		* secure network access control - obtain ID of device and/or user before allowing it on the network. RADIUS is the prefered protocol

	TACACS+ 
		developed by cisco
		TCP port 49
		capable of breaking out AAA into independent functions, making it popular with network device AAA

	RADIUS
		IETF standard
		client/server model like TACACS+
		Supports EAP, unlike TACACS+ which does not
		RADIUS needs to return all auth parameters in a single reply. TACACS+ can request auth parameters seperatly and multile times

Configuring AAA for network Device access control
	configure TACACS+ on an IOS device

	1. create local user w/ full privileges
		username [username] privilege 15 alogrithm-type {md5|sha256|script} secret [password]
	2. enable AAA functions
		aaa new-model
	3. add a tacacs server (depends on ios version)
		on Version IOS before 15.x
		 tacacs-server host [hostname|host-ip-address] key [key-string]
		on version IOS 15.x and later
		 tacacs server [name]
		 address ipv4 [hostname|host-ip-address]
		 key [key-string]
	4. create an AAA group
		aaa group server tacacs+ [group-name]
		server name [server-name]
	5. enable AAA login auth 
		aaa authentication login [default | custom-list-name] [method1]...
		- method lists enable login auth, default applies the method list that follow in the command. ,custom list allows for a custom name for the list that follows
		- to apply a custom list
			login authentication [custom list name] - under line configuration
		- these are applied left to right
	6. enable AAA authorization - enables shell auth for all lines except the console line
		aaa authorization exec [default|custom-list-name]
	
	7. enable AAA auth for the console 
		aaa authorization console
	8. enable AAA command auth
		aaa authorization commands [priv level] 
	9. enable command auth in global config
		aaa authorization config-commands
       10. enable login accounting
		aaa accounting exec 
		- common to use keyword start-stop - accounting starts when a session does and stops once a session ends
       11. Enable command accounting 
		aaa accounting commands [priviledge level]
		- applied per priviledge level

	* use if-authenticated method at the end of every auth command to allow commands in the event tacacs servers are unreachable but a user is locall authed
	
		
	Verify AAA
		show privilege
		sho version

Zone-Based Firewalls (ZBFW)
	ACLs are stateless, dont inspect packet payload
	stateful firewalls can review layer 4 - 7 to review state of transmission

	ZBFW - stateful firewall integrated into ios
	uses security zones, router interfaces are assigned to a zone that establishes a security boundary. 
		* interfaces in the same zones can communicate freely

	self zone - system level - includes all the routers ip addresses, all traffic is permitted by default to support mgmt and control plane functions
		defined automatically
	
	default zone - system level zone - any interface not assigned to a different zone gets placed here by default
		traffic that is sent from an interface not in a zone, to one that is, traffic is dropped, enabling the default zone allows this traffic to flow

	configuration
		1. define zone, in this case for the internet facing interface
			zone security OUTSIDE
			 description External Interface
		2. define inspection class map i.e. how traffic will be classified
			class-map type inspection [match-all|match-any] (class name)
			* match-all - (Boolean AND) traffic needs to match all the conditions in the class map to qualify - this is default 
			* match-any - (Boolean OR) traffic needs to match only one condition in the class map

			ip access-list extended DHCP-IN
		 	 permit udo any eq bootps any eq bootpc
			ip access-list extended permit ACL-IPSEC
		 	 permit udp any any eq non500-isakmp
		 	 permit udp any any eq isakmp

			class-map type inspect match-any CLASS-OUTSIDE-TO-SELF-INSPECT
		 	 match access-group ACL-IPSEC
		 	 match access-group DHCP-IN

		verify: 
			show class-map type inspect

		3. define inspection policy map - applies the firewall policy to the class map
			policy-map type inspect (policy name)
		       you then define a firewall action under the class map
			drop - log - silently discards packets that match the class map
			pass - log- router forwards packets from source to destination zone, but only in one direction, you will need to define a policy to permit return traffic
			inspect - gives the option for state based control - router maintains state and permits traffic flows in opposite direction - has an implicity drop
			
			full config 
			policy-map type inspect POLICY-OUTSIDE-TO-INSIDE
			 class type inspect OUTSIDE-TO-INSIDE_INSPECT
				inspect
			 class type inspect OUTSIDE-TO-INSIDE_PASS
				pass
			 class DEFAULT-DROP
				drop
			
			verify:
				show policy-map type inspect
		4. apply policy map to traffic flow source and destination
			zone-pair security OUTSIDE-zone source OUTSIDE  destination self
			 service-policy type inspect POLICY-OUTSIDE-TO-INSIDE

		5. apply zones to interfaces
			interface GigabitEthernet0/1
			 zone-member security OUTSIDE
	
			verify: 
				show policy-map type inspect zone-pair (zone pair name)
		
			
			view counters of traffic hitting it
				show ip access

	verify ZBFW

Control-Plane Policing (CoPPP
	Qos policy applied to or from a routers control plane CPU
	intent is to protect CPU from unexpected traffic spikes that could impact stability
	typically, only an input policy is used
	
	police command 
		options conform, exceed, and violate
	configure ACLs
		ip access-list extended ACL-CoPP-ICMP
		 permit icmp any any echo-reply
		 permit icmp any any ttl-exceeded
		 permit icmp any any unreachable
		 permit icmp any any echo 
		 permit udp any any range 33434 33463 ttl eq 1

	configuring class maps
		class-map match-all CLASS-CoPP-ICMP
		 match access-group name ACL-CoPP-ICMP
		
	Configuring Policy Map
		balancing between preventing overload and not impacting prod traffic is difficult.
		setting violate action to transmit at first is a good idea
		
		policy-map POLICY-CoPP
		 class CLASS-CoPP-ICMP
		  police 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit
			violate-action drop
		class CLASS-CoPP-IPsec
		 police 64000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit
		 	violate-action transmit

	applying the policy map
		control-plane
		 service-policy input POLICY-CoPP
	
	verify:
		show policy-map control-plane input

	
Device Hardening
	* Disable topology discovery tools:
		(CDP, LLDP)
		no cdp enable
		no lldp transmit
		no lldp receive
	* Disable TCP and UDP small service 
		service tcp-keepalive-in 
		service tcp-keepalive-out
			sends tcp keepalives, kills half-open or orphaned connections
	
	* disable ip redirect services
		icmp redirects inform a device of a better path to a destination network, IOS will send if it detects network traffic hairpinning
		no ip redirects
	
	* Disable proxy address resolution protocol (ARP)
		Proxy ARP - technique a router uses to answer ARP requests inteded for a different router. 
		router fakes its identity and sends out an ARP request for the router that is responsible for that network
		this can be spoofed 
	
	* Disable service configuration
		Prevents automatic config from remote devices
			no service config 

	* Disable Maintenance Operation Protocol (MOP)
		not needed, disable globablly
		no mop enabled

	* Disable packet assembler/disassembler (PAD) service
		used for x.25, not needed
		no service pad
